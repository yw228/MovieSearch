The my-vue-project should be the frontend or the webapp and the backend is renamed as webservice"

Before the project make sure you have node.js install and run `npm install` at `frontend/my-vue-project`

To run the front end g to `frontend/my-vue-project`

`run npm serve`

To run backend server go to `frontend/my-vue-project/webservice`
